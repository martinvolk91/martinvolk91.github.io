title: About me
---

Welcome to my website!<br/>
My name is Martin Volk, I come from Slovenia and I currently live in Vienna, Austria.<br/>

I graduated in computer science from the University of Ljubljana, focusing on software development and 
artificial intelligence, which explains my professional background as a software developer and data analyst.

I have a wide area of interests ranging from mathematics, science, data science, 
journalism, economics, and many others. <br/>
I created this page to create a central point for all my projects and activities.

On the "Projects" page you will find some of my projects I'm currently working on and some projects I worked on
in the past. Some of my projects are not public yet as I have used different git providers in the past, so I still
need to import them to GitHub.
